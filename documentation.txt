To open a file selector dialog box in response to
 a button click using vanilla JavaScript, 
 you can create an input element of type file, 
 and then trigger its click() 
method when the button is clicked.

we add an event listener to the file-input element that listens for a change event.
 When the user selects a file, the change event is fired, 
and we can access the selected file(s) using the files property of the file-input element.
